# InterONet
A Full-Stack-Programmable SDN Testbed leaded by XJTU.

## Web UI
* A slice including SDN switch and hosts could be created by tenants.
* Any topology can be customized via simply DRAG and DROP among switches in Web.
* More fine-grained network control are supported, Comparing OpenStack.
* Cross-Domain could be released in next generation InterONet.

## Full-Stack-Programmable Switch
* FPGA, kernel, filesystem, SDN switch and SDN controller could be programmable.
  * Switch FPGA logic could be dispatched in any switch as you like.
  * Linux Kernel could be re-compile as you like.
  * SDN Switch like OVS, ofsoftswitch13 could be re-build as you like.
  * SDN controller like Ryu, ODL, FloodLight could be provided as you like.
* Any layer of above feature can be  programable as you like.
* What we would do is giving your a experimental platform.

## Virtualization & Physicalization
* KVM technology would be used to guarantee the High Availability of InterONet.
* One Switch would be allocated for ONLY ONE tenant for ensuring network performance.

## Open API
* Open JSON-RPC API for tenant to make InterONet programmable.
